# 60DaysOfUdacity

This repository contains the record of my participation in the 60DaysOfUdacity challenge organized in the Secure and Private AI challenge course from Udacity and Facebook.  
The records for each day are recorded in Google Spreadsheet document linked below.

## Secure and Private AI Keystone Projects for Differential privacy and Federated Learning.

The list below directs to the repositories that store my implementation of the final projects for each privacy protection mechanism discussed in the course.


1. [My Implementation of the Differential privacy in Deep learning and PATE analysis final project using the MNIST digit Dataset.](https://github.com/nerytompz/Differential-privacy-for-deeplearning-project)  
2. [My Implementation of the Federated learning final project using the MNIST digit Dataset](https://github.com/nerytompz/Federated-Learning-PrivateandSecureAiUdacity/tree/master/Federated%20Learning%20project/)
3. [My Implementation of the Secure Federated learning final project using the MNIST digit Dataset and distributing among 10 Virtual devices.](https://github.com/nerytompz/Federated-Learning-PrivateandSecureAiUdacity/tree/master/Secure%20Federated%20Learning%20project)

## PROJECT SHOWCASE CHALLENGE
For the Project showcase challenge, I implemented Money count, which is a Proposed application to help the Visually Impaired count money and which also uses Differential privacy, Data anonymization, and offline image analysis to conserve and protect user privacy.  
I am very happy and grateful that my project was awarded the 10th best project in the project showcase challenge.

## Differential privacy and PATE analysis Webinar

Over the course of the challenge, I was most active in the various Differential privacy channels of the Secure and Private AI challenge slack. I tried my best to answer questions but observed that a lot of people had issues and confusion, regarding differential privacy in deep learning and PATE analysis and also how to apply differential privacy and PATE analysis in the final project for the differential privacy in the deep learning section of the course.
 
In order to address this issue, I organized a webinar that lasted over 2 hours that involved an explanation of differential privacy, PATE analysis and also had a walkthrough of my project for the Differential privacy and PATE analysis section. I also recorded the webinar and reposted it periodically to ensure those that missed attending it could still benefit from it.
